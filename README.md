This was my first major project, written during the summer of 2018. At this stage in my education I’d only covered GCSE and FSMQ level mathematics, so I didn’t realise that much of what I’d been working on during those weeks could have been done far more efficiently with a few simple matrix equations… Nevertheless I had a lot of fun writing it and am quite proud of the end result.
